## Personal Profile
Name: Rachel Lu

Pronouns: She/her/hers

Program: MURP, Transportation Policy and Planning

Graduation Year: 2022

Description: I'm currently based in Los Angeles, but I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, MI and spent the last 7 years living in Oakland, CA. My background is in fundraising and marketing in both the non-profit and private sector. My research intersts in grad school lie at the intersection of transportation, sustainability, and environmental justice. I have a passing familiarity with GIS but am new to coding. 

## Course Description
The goal of course 206a is to expose students to the foundations of spatial data science. Through this course, students will learn to: 
* Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
* Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
* Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
* Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

## Project Ideas
I'm interested in projects at any scale. Projects ideas include: 

1. Transportation, environmental justice, and pollution through a race and class lens, particularly in communities near major ports, shipping/warehouse hubs, or major freeways
    1. Example: Expansion of shipping warehouses like Amazon in the Inland Empire and potential impact on air pollution exposure for low-income communities of color 
2. Autonomous vehicle adoption and potential associated transportation mode shifts and/or pollution impacts

## My Class Objectives 
* Gain a foundational understanding of how to code
* Practice making visually compelling and easily understood maps
* Learn best practices for visualiziing data
