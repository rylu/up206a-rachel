# Week 7: Individual Assignment 

For this week’s assignment, I read the Millard-Ball (2020) paper, “The value of residential streets”. The paper provides a framework for street width that is grounded in economics by assessing the value of the underlying land and the opportunity costs associated with street width. It seems like it would be a no-brainer to reduce street widths based on Millard-Ball’s economic argument, with high-cost counties finding cost savings up to $107,000 per residential unit. Reducing street width could be an important and underutilized tool to increase housing affordability in California. While I hope that, once published, his paper will have significant impact, I also wonder how street width reductions on the scale that Millard-Ball suggests will be received given the car-oriented society we live in.  Certainly, his research found that street widths are already trending down in US counties, but not to the scale that Millard-Ball mentions as an absolute minimum utility—16 feet. Schoup’s research on the economic waste generated by parking minimums has certainly gained allies in urban planning spaces, but it has continued to be an uphill battle to reduce or eliminate parking minimums at the city and state level. Hopefully, as the next wave of transportation advocates, our cohort can benefit from Millard-Ball’s research and take it into the field. 

My question for Adam is:  To what extent do you see reducing street widths being a part of the housing affordability solution in California? Although street widths have trended down since 2000, land pricing and housing costs in Coastal California continue to trend up.
