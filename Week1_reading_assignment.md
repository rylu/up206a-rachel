#The Future of Climate Change Lies in Data Analytics

The Medium article *The Future of Global Warming Lies in Data Analytics* discusses the ways in which climate scientists are using data analytics to understand current climate change impacts and predict future trends. The article asserts that scientists can use data analytics to more efficiently leverage large amounts of data and make better predictions than with traditional statistics. Data analytics can help us solve for climate change problem by allowing us to create maps that model sea level rise, monitor illegal logging, forecast air pollution, and much more to inform adaptation strategies and future development. 


This article spoke to me because it illustrated the breadth of questions that spatialized data can answer. I am only just beginning to explore the potential for research and data to help solve for issues I care about, such as the intersection of climate change and environmental justice, but it’s clear that data analytics has a large role to play. The article also introduced me to a nuance I had not previously considered: certain research questions may be better answered with data analytics than with traditional statistics. As I don’t have a strong background in either, I’m curious about how to make the distinction between questions better answered with data analytics vs. traditional statistics.
