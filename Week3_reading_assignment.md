# Week 3 Reading Assignment

For this reading assignment, I watched Geoff Boeing's presentation to last quarter's class. 

Urban data science is one of those things that sounds cool in a futuristic way but also something that I haven't really thought of as something relevant to my life. Hearing Geoff talk about the applications of OSMnx was great because it really grounded the concept of urban data science in its practical application and future possibilities. 
I was particularly intrigued by the potential for OSMnx's potential to assess resilience from a connectivity standpoint - that higher intersection density and fewer one way streets increase resilience in the face of disaster events, and that OSMnx can help model these scenarios. I'm really excited to see what pathways coding and open source data can open up for planners. Instead of depending on software development companies, we can directly create the tools that we need. In the discussion, Geoff talked about how urban data science is now a pre-requisite at USC. As urban data science becomes more and more dominant in urban planning, I wonder whether softwares like ESRI will still have a place in th profession. I'm sure that, as magical as Python seems right now when I'm just diving in, it also has its limits.
